# Market-Research-Analysis
This Market Research focuses on customer satisfaction and product/service improvement of Maria Granel stores. Maria Granel is an organic grocery store 
which sells its products in bulk, aiming to promote a more sustainable consumer behaviour and simultaneously improve health benefits and environmental 
impact.

With this, we hope to aid Maria Granel in attracting new customers from their competitors, as well as raising awareness regarding environmental issues 
to more people through new or better products/services. Through this, we will be able to better understand the overall satisfaction of the customers and 
what they feel can be improved and how.
